Kirin deals with real-time public-transport data updates for Navitia.\
When feeds are provided to Kirin by a contributor, it requests navitia to find the corresponding vehicle journey and apply
the update, that is then posted in a queue for navitia to pick.

The feeds can be of the following type:

- PIV : A proprietary realtime information feed for SNCF.
  JSON files are received on a RabbitMQ queue processed by
  the Kirin PIV worker (example of such feed
  [here](tests/fixtures/piv/stomp_20201022_23187_blank_fixture.json)).
- GTFS-RT : A realtime information format that comes with the GTFS format (base-schedule informations).
  Documentation is available [here](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs-realtime/?hl=en).
  Typically, a transport authority will provide a server where GTFS-RT protobuf files can be consumed and
  regularly polled.

## Setup

This describes a "classic" setup.

A "dockerized" local setup is also demonstrated in fab_kirin, see
[instructions](https://github.com/CanalTP/fab_kirin/demo/README.md).

Kirin supports Python 2.7.

- Install dependencies with

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
    ```

    (virtualenv is strongly advised)

- You also need a redis-server to use cache on some requests and a rabbitmq-server to post updated data in the queue.
    It can be installed with :

    ```sh
    sudo apt-get install redis-server rabbitmq-server protobuf-compiler
    ```

- Setup the Kirin database (postgresql >= 9.1 is required):

    ```sh
    sudo -i -u postgres
    # Create a user
    createuser -P navitia (password "navitia")

    # Create database
    createdb -O navitia kirin

    # Create database for tests
    createdb -O navitia chaos_testing
    ctrl + d
    ```

- Create a configuration file by copying and editing ```kirin/default_settings.py```

    ```sh
    NAVITIA_URL = '<url of the navitia server>' # ex: 'http://localhost:5000/'
    DEBUG = True
    log_formatter = 'json'
    ```

- Create a file ```.env``` with the path to you configuration file:

    ```sh
    KIRIN_CONFIG_FILE=default_settings.py
    KIRIN_LOG_FORMATTER='json'  #Â If you wish to have logs formated as json (more details)
    ```

- Build the protocol buffer files

    ```sh
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    ./setup.py build_pbf
    ```

- Build the version file:

    ```sh
    ./setup.py build_version
    ```

- Update the database schema (requires honcho):

    ```sh
    pip install honcho
    honcho run ./manage.py db upgrade
    ```

- Run the development server:

    ```sh
    honcho start
    ```

    This command runs several processes :

    - a server to listen to incoming requests
    - a scheduler and its worker to perform tasks scheduled in KIRIN_CONFIG_FILE
      Note: one of the tasks scheduled is a poller to retrieve GTFS-RT files, only useful when there's a feed provider URL defined.
      If not needed, this specific task can be disabled in KIRIN_CONFIG_FILE by removing the 'poller' task in the 'CELERYBEAT_SCHEDULE' section. This will avoid having logs and errors about GTFS-RT.
    - a job to read the info already available in Kirin database. Note that this step of data reloading at boot is mandatory for Kirin to be able to process future real-time feeds.

- Enjoy: you can now request the Kirin API

### Docker

A docker image of Kirin can be built using the Dockerfile:
`docker build -t kirin .`
When running this image, the Kirin web server is launched and an optional *port* can be given to expose the API.
`docker run -p <port>:9090 kirin`

Note: a Kirin database is needed on localhost for the requests to be done successfully.

## API

Kirin API provides several endpoints (that can be requested through port 5000 by default, or
port 54746 if using honcho).\
To list all available endpoints:

```sh
curl 'http://localhost:5000/'
```

  ]
}
```

#### POST

To create a new contributor, parameters need to be given in json sent in the body as described [here](documentation/internal_format.md).\
Please be careful with format of booleans and numbers :wink:

```sh
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:5000/contributors/' -d'{"feed_url": "http://0.0.0.0./civilia/TTT/pb/tripUpdates.pb", "retrieval_interval": 10, "navitia_coverage": "ca-qc-sherbrooke", "is_active": true, "navitia_token": "9489dd5f-46b4-mmmmmmmmmm3bfba0c71e8a", "connector_type": "gtfs-rt", "id": "realtime.sherbrooke"}' -H'content-type: application/json'
```

``` json
{
  "contributor": {
    "feed_url": "http://0.0.0.0./civilia/TTT/pb/tripUpdates.pb",
    "retrieval_interval": 10,
    "navitia_coverage": "ca-qc-sherbrooke",
    "is_active": true,
    "navitia_token": "9489dd5f-46b4-mmmmmmmmmm3bfba0c71e8a",
    "connector_type": "gtfs-rt",
    "id": "realtime.sherbrooke",
    "nb_days_to_keep_trip_update": 3,
    "nb_days_to_keep_rt_update": 10
  }
}
```

#### PUT

Modifies a contributor and has same parameters as POST.\
Please be careful with format of booleans and numbers :wink:

When a parameter is missing, it is not changed.

When PUTing the exact result of a GET nothing is changed.

```sh
curl -X PUT 'http://localhost:5000/contributors/' -d'{"feed_url": "http://0.0.0.0./civilia/TTT/pb/tripUpdates.pb", "retrieval_interval": 10, "navitia_coverage": "ca-qc-sherbrooke", "is_active": true, "navitia_token": "9489dd5f-46b4-mmmmmmmmmm3bfba0c71e8a", "connector_type": "gtfs-rt", "id": "realtime.sherbrooke"}' -H'content-type: application/json'
```

```json
{
  "contributor": {
    "feed_url": "http://0.0.0.0./civilia/TTT/pb/tripUpdates.pb",
    "retrieval_interval": 10,
    "navitia_coverage": "ca-qc-sherbrooke",
    "is_active": true,
    "navitia_token": "9489dd5f-46b4-mmmmmmmmmm3bfba0c71e8a",
    "connector_type": "gtfs-rt",
    "id": "realtime.sherbrooke",
    "nb_days_to_keep_trip_update": 3,
    "nb_days_to_keep_rt_update": 10
  }
}
```

#### DELETE

Deletes a specific contributor

```sh
curl -X DELETE 'http://localhost:5000/contributors/realtime.toto'
```

### Health (GET)

Returns info about the health of Kirin **webservice** (whether it can be used or not).

```sh
curl 'http://localhost:5000/health'
```

Returns message "OK" (HTTP status `200`) if Kirin webservice is healthy, "KO" (HTTP status `503`) otherwise.
This endpoint checks that the webservice runs and responds (obviously).

It also checks:

- the connection to postgresql database (ability to process RT feeds and store initial feed and the result)
- the connection to Navitia (ability to process RT feeds)

This does not check:

- the connection to redis (ability to cache and use circuit-breaker)
- the connection to rabbitmq (ability to send immediately result to Navitia for integration)

For details on errors or statuses... check `/status` :-)

### Status (GET)

Returns info about the Kirin and the previous jobs performed

```sh
curl 'http://localhost:5000/status'
```

In the response received:

- last_update: last time Kirin received a file (or pulled it, depending the client) in order to update navitia data.
- last_valid_update: last time Kirin received a file that was valid and managed to update navitia data properly.
- last_update_error: information about error from the last time Kirin processed a file and a problem occurred. It can either be a problem about the file or the data update. The field will be empty if last_update = last_valid_update.
- navitia_url: root url of the navitia server used to consolidate real-time information received by Kirin.
- db_connection: state of the connection to postgresql database (condition for /health to be "OK")
- navitia_connection: state of the connection to navitia (condition for /health to be "OK")
Other info are available about Kirin ("version"), the database ("db_version", "db_pool_status") and the rabbitmq ("rabbitmq_info").

### SNCF's realtime feeds

For the SNCF's realtime feeds to be taken into account by navitia, some parameters need to be set
for both Kirin and Kraken (the navitia core calculator).

- In Kirin:

    - Add a contributor 'piv' using the end point `/contributors` (see example above)

- In Kraken:

    - kraken.ini:

    ```ini
    [GENERAL] # The following parameters need to be added to the already existing ones in the GENERAL section
    is_realtime_enabled = true
    kirin_timeout = 180000 # in ms (optional)

    [BROKER] # It represents the rabbitmq-server, fill the following parameters according to your settings
    host = localhost
    port = 5672
    username = guest
    password = guest
    exchange = navitia
    ```

#### PIV (RabbitMQ input)

An input PIV queue can be provided and configured through `/contributors` parameters.\
This queue will then be processed by the Kirin PIV worker.\
PIV feed contains modifications about a vehicle journey (delay, disruption, deletion, ...)
that will be processed and pushed in the RabbitMQ queue destined to Kraken.


For the PIV to be taken into account by navitia, please add the common SNCF's parameters above, plus:

- In Kraken:

    - kraken.ini:

    ```ini
    [BROKER] # in the BROKER section existing from common part
    rt_topics = realtime.sncf.piv  # kirin's contributor.id: it's possible to add multiple topics simultaneously
    ```

## Maintenance

### RabbitMQ management

To protect the RabbitMQ instance used, it is advised to add probes on PIV queues,
as they may grow fast (especially if no consumer is plugged).

It is also possible to protect them using RabbitMQ [max-length-bytes policies](https://www.rabbitmq.com/maxlength.html).

### Definitely remove a contributor from configuration

A command to clean inactive contributors is available, to be triggered manually:

```bash
python ./manage.py purge_contributor <contributor_id>
```

If Kirin is deployed inside docker containers on a platform, you may locate the docker-compose file defining a `kirin`
webservice that was used to launch containers.\
Then for example, if the file is `docker-compose_kirin.yml`, you can launch:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose_kirin.yml run --rm --no-deps kirin ./manage.py purge_contributor <contributor_id>
```

This will check that for the given contributor, `is_active=false` and that
no more object (TripUpdate or RealTimeUpdate) is linked to that contributor in Kirin database.

Those objects are progressively purged by automatic jobs configured in the settings file.
